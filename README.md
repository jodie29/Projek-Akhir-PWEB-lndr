## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Local Setup: Migrations & Seeders

If you encounter issues with user logins (e.g., couriers or admins can't sign in), it's usually because the database schema or seed data isn't set up properly.

1. Ensure your .env is configured properly (DB connection, etc.)
2. Run migrations:

	php artisan migrate

3. Re-seed default users + services (this will create default admin, courier and customer users):

	php artisan db:seed --class=AdminUserSeeder

This will ensure the `users.role` column exists and that seeded users are created with hashed passwords (bcrypt) so Auth::attempt works correctly.

## Troubleshooting login errors

- "Email atau Password tidak cocok": user typed wrong credentials — try resetting the password from the admin area, or re-seed.
- "This password does not use the Bcrypt algorithm": adds that the password stored in database appears to be plaintext or non-bcrypt hash. Reset the affected user's password via tinker or an admin UI:

  php artisan tinker
  $u = \App\Models\User::where('email', 'courier@powerwash.com')->first();
  $u->password = Hash::make('12345678');
  $u->save();

  And then login using the new password.
